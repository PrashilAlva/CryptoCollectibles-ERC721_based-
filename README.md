# CryptoCollectibles-ERC721_based-

This CryptoCollectibles is based on the [ERC721 Non-Fungible Token Standard](http://erc721.org/).

##  What is ERC-721? 
**ERC-721** is a free, open standard that describes how to build non-fungible or unique tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. While most tokens are fungible (every token is the same as every other token), **ERC-721 Tokens** are all unique. 

One of the most known examples for an **ERC-721 Token** is [Crypto Kitties] (https://www.cryptokitties.co/), where each Cat is an unique **ERC-721 Token**.
